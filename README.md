# bank-details
## Overview 



#### Feed 1: The balances
This is a data feed, where each *event* represents a single balance update for a given account. 

A *single* record looks like this
```
{"accountNumber": "abc", "lastUpdateTimestamp": "2020-01-01T01:02:03.8Z", "balance": 89.1}
```

#### Feed 2: The transactions

This is a data feed representing transactions that are occuring. Each record will be a single transaction at the bank. Keep in mind that there are *two* types of transactions: 1. `DEPOSIT` and 2. `WITHDRAW`. 

A *single* record looks like this
For a `DEPOSIT`:
```
{"accountNumber": "abc", "transactionTs": "2020-01-03T01:02:03.8Z", "type": "DEPOSIT", "amount": 89.1}
```
Or a `WITHDRAW`
```
{"accountNumber": "abc", "transactionTs": "2020-01-03T01:02:03.8Z", "type": "WITHDRAW", "amount": 89.1}
```



1. Given an `accountNumber`, return the latest balance. 
2. Given an `accountNumber` and a `time range` such as: `Today`, `Last 7 days`, `last Month` and the more general case of a range between `date X` and `date Y`. For example, I should be able to ask for all my transactions between `January 8th, 2019` and `November 28th, 2020`.
3. Repeat 2, but filter for `type`. I.E. Show me transactions with type `WITHDRAW`.
